Aura AI - Next-Gen Fitness IntelligenceAura AI is a cutting-edge fitness application that leverages computer vision and artificial intelligence to provide real-time form correction, rep counting, and personalized workout analysis. Built with a modern tech stack, it offers a seamless, gamified experience to help users train smarter and safer.🚀 FeaturesReal-time Pose Detection: Powered by TensorFlow.js and MoveNet for lightning-fast skeletal tracking directly in the browser.AI Form Correction: Instant visual and textual feedback on your exercise form (e.g., "Go Lower", "Straighten Back").Automated Rep Counting: precise repetition tracking for Squats, Push-ups, Jumping Jacks, and Bicep Curls.Gamified Progression: Earn XP, climb the global leaderboard, and unlock achievements based on your consistency and performance.Comprehensive Analytics: Visualize your workout history, calorie burn, and progress trends over time.Secure Authentication: Robust user management powered by NextAuth.js (Google, GitHub, & Email support).Aesthetic UI: A stunning, dark-mode interface designed with Tailwind CSS, featuring glassmorphism and fluid animations.🛠️ Tech StackFramework: Next.js 14 (App Router)Language: TypeScriptStyling: Tailwind CSS & Shadcn UIAI/ML: TensorFlow.js & MoveNetAuthentication: NextAuth.js (Auth.js)Database: PostgreSQL (via Vercel Postgres)ORM: PrismaDeployment: Vercel📦 InstallationClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/aura-fitness.git](https://github.com/yourusername/aura-fitness.git)
cd aura-fitness
Install dependencies:npm install
Set up environment variables:Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:DATABASE_URL="your_postgres_database_url"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your_nextauth_secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your_google_client_id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your_google_client_secret"
Initialize the database:npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
Run the development server:npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application.🧠 How It WorksCamera Input: The app accesses your webcam stream securely.Pose Estimation: The MoveNet model analyzes the video feed frame-by-frame to identify key body points (joints).Geometry Analysis: Custom algorithms calculate angles between joints (e.g., hip-knee-ankle for squats) to determine exercise states.State Machine: The system tracks movement phases (e.g., "Down" vs. "Up") to count reps validly.Feedback Loop: If angles deviate from ideal biomechanics, the UI triggers corrective alerts.🤝 ContributingContributions are welcome!
